Description: Providing C implementation for the computing of monotonic spline bases, including M-splines, I-splines, and C-splines, denoted by MIC splines. The definitions of the spline bases are described in Meyer (2008) <doi: 10.1214/08-AOAS167>. The package also provides the computing of constrained least-squares estimates when a subset of or all of the regression coefficients are constrained to be non-negative.
